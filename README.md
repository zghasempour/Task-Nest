# Task Nest App


A fully functional To-Do application built using Kotlin. This app is designed with modern Android development best practices, incorporating essential components and libraries like ROOM, Navigation Component, LiveData, ViewModel, and Data Binding.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, Delete To-Dos:** Create new tasks, modify existing ones, or remove them from your list.
- **Persisted Data:** All tasks are stored locally using ROOM, ensuring data is available even after the app is closed.
- **Live Data Updates:** The UI is automatically updated in real-time when the underlying data changes, thanks to LiveData.
- **MVVM Architecture:** The app is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making the app more maintainable and testable.
- **Navigation Component:** Seamless navigation between screens using Android's Navigation Component.
- **Data Binding:** Efficiently binds UI components in your layouts to the app's data sources.
